description: >-
  We wanted to create a space that would allow the user to experience an
  ordinary thing in an unusual way. We were interested in ecosystems, and wanted
  to connect our ecosystem to the state of Georgia (home), and also the larger
  realms of history, mythology, and health; which are their own kinds of
  ecosystems, or containers. Pithos.
